## What I’m working on <br><br>

- Architected materials and structures (single-phase & multiphase) — hybrid manufacturing workflows, mechanical properties, and applications.<br><br>

- Symbolic ML, polynomial fitting, and neural networks for structure–property mapping and reverse design.<br><br>

- Experimental modal analysis with Dewesoft — identifying modal frequencies and damping ratios.<br><br>

- Wave manipulation design: vibration isolation, sound absorption, and waveguiding.
